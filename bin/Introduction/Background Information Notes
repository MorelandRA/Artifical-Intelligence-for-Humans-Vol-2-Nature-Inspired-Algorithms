Vectors
1D Arrays
Used to store data about a single instance of an object
For example, in the Iris data set, there are columns in an instance of a flower: Sepal length, sepal
width, petal length, petal width, and iris species

Distance
Euclidian distance, the actual distance between two vectors. Often used by machine learning because it is
fast to compare two vectors with the same number of elements.
distance(a,b) = sqrt(sum from i = 1 to n of ((ai - bi)^2))

Modeling with an Radial-Basis Function (RBF) network
RBFs are a model for regression and classification. Regression returns numbers, and classification
returns non-number values. RFBs modify a random parameter vector to train, and use this as its long-term
memory. 

Radial-Basis Functions
RBFs are used by many AI algorithms. They are symmetric, and usually peak at the center at 1. They can
have many dimensions, but the output is always a single scalar value. The most common RFB is the
Gaussian function / normal distribution / bell curve. An RBF can be used by calculating r, or ||x-xi||,
where ||x|| represents a distance, usually the Euclidian distance. In this book, all examples will use
the Euclidian distance. Therefore, r is the Euclidian distance between the center and x, which all 
examples in this book will also use. PHI will always be used to represent the RBF, which is e^(-r^2).

Radial-Basis Function Networks
RBF networks give a weighted sum of at least one RBF. The output of this network is f(X) = the sum
from i = 1 to N of (aip(||biX=ci||)) where X is the input vector, c is the the center of the RBF, p is 
the chosen RBF, a is the vector coefficient for each RBF, and b is the vector coefficient to weight the
input attributes.
